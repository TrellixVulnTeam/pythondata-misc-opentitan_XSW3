    [sw/testutils] Update adc_ctrl ISR testutil to clear status CSRs
    
    In addition to the standard IRQ status register that must be
    acknowledged when an IRQ is fired, the ADC Controller has two internal
    CSRs, the filter status and INTR status registers, that must be
    acknowledged (cleared). This was discussed in #11354, and determined
    that future generations of the IP will remove this complexity. However,
    until then, this commit will mask this complexity in software, specifically
    in the autogenerated ADC Controller ISR testutil.
    
    This addresses #11354.
